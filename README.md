A curated list of CHADS:  Cheap Ass Developers Sites relocated from a domain

![Cheap Ass Developer Sites](logo.jpeg?raw=true "Looking for that Cheap Ass Developer's Site?")

## "What's a CHAD?"...you say?

You remember that fun/stupid/weird website your friend bought a custom domain name for?

Is the site not resolving now?

Is it owned by someone else?

Did they kill the project?

Fear not, that friend probably wised up and became a CHAD: a **Cheap Ass Developer** who refused to renew a domain name lease for a fun side project and relocated their project to a different domain.

This repo is a list of these CHADS. Find your CHADS. Migrate your CHADS. Embrace your CHADS.
